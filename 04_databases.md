# Bases de datos de secuencias de DNA

## [NCBI Nucleotide](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore)
> The Nucleotide database is a collection of sequences from several sources, including GenBank, RefSeq, TPA and PDB. Genome, gene and transcript sequence data provide the foundation for biomedical research and discovery.

## [ENA](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena)
> The European Nucleotide Archive provides a comprehensive record of the world's nucleotide sequencing information, covering raw sequencing data, sequence assembly information and functional annotation.

## [NCBI genomes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome)
> This resource organizes information on genomes including sequences, maps, chromosomes, assemblies, and annotations.

## [ENSEMBL](http://ensembl.org/)
> ENSEMBL is a genome browser for genomes of model organisms that supports research in comparative genomics, evolution, sequence variation and transcriptional regulation. Ensembl annotate genes, computes multiple alignments, predicts regulatory function and collects disease data. Ensembl tools include BLAST, BLAT, BioMart and the Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) for all supported species.

## [SRA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) + [ENA](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena)
> Sequence Read Archive makes biological sequence data available to the research community to enhance reproducibility and allow for new discoveries by comparing data sets. The SRA stores raw sequencing data and alignment information from high-throughput sequencing platforms, including Roche 454 GS System®, Illumina Genome Analyzer®, Applied Biosystems SOLiD System®, Helicos Heliscope®, Complete Genomics®, and Pacific Biosciences SMRT®.
